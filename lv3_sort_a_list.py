######## SORT A LIST #########
##############################


# INSTRUCTIONS:

# Make a function that takes a list and returns it sorted
# Maybe don't use some built in function, implement it yourself
# Give it a second input that says whether to sort in ascending or descending order


# EXAMPLES

# Input:
# [9, 2, 6, 7] and "asc"
# Output
# [2, 6, 7, 9]
